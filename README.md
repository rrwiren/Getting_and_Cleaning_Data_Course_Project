# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This repository is hosting my week 4 assignment for the Getting and Cleaning Data course which is part of the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization at Coursera.

The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

UCI - Machine Learning Repository - 
[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)



## Description of files

1. run_analysis.R - the actual R script containing all the code to perform the analysis and produce the outcome

1. average_data.txt - the outcome of when running the run_analysis.R script, a tidy dataset according to instructions 

1. README.md - this file

1. CodeBook.md - a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data
