# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This repository is hosting my week 4 assignment for the Getting and Cleaning Data course which is part of the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization by at Coursera.

The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
